What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

     When you initialize a repositoryyou are creating a git version control file system.
 This means that git will now record all committed changes and keep a snapshot of all of
 your files status for each commit. This is neccesary so that you can go back and review
prior states of your files. Creating a git repository allows for function such as diff 
and log to be preformed on your files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the respository? What 
value do you think it offers?  

    The staging area is just that an intermediate zone between your working directory an
d the git repository, it's used to stage your commits to your git repository. This
 provides you with finite control on what files are commited and at what time. You have
 finer control on determining logical commits when you have been working on many differ
erent files in your working directory. Allowing you to selective commits the changes you
've made to many files allows you if you wish to make a comment for each individual file
.
